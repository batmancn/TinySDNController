# Statically configure the Timer_Service, which must have been linked
# statically into the application process.  Up to 4 arguments are
# passed in.  The final 3 arguments are retrieved from environment
# variables, so they can be set by changing your environment before
# running the main program.  If you don't have these variables set
# they are ignored.
